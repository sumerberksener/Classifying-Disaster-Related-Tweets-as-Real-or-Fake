# Classifying-Disaster-Related-Tweets-as-Real-or-Fake
In this project I have analysed a dataset from Kaggle about disaster related tweets. I used NLP to classify these tweets as real or fake. 
I started by cleaning the data and creating a WordCloud of the `text` column in the dataset. 
I trained four different NLP models to classify the tweets. The accuracy scores achieved by these models were as follows:
1.  This is the first 
2. second 
3. third
4.fourth


The data I used can also be obtained from this [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview).
